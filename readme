boundaries: standardized collision objects to prevent player movement

zone of detection: zone around player widget to detect boundaries ahead of collision, zone will dictate player 
                    movement around boundaries
player widget sizing: player widget should be half length of canvas, allowing upper sprite to overlap objects
                        before collisions occur, preventing head-bumping boundaries
